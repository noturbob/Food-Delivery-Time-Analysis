KEY INSIGHTS:
  1. Model performs very well with R² of 0.9477
  2. Average prediction error is 1.70 minutes
  3. 99.5% of predictions are within 5 minutes of actual
  4. Model tends to over-predict on average
  5. Residuals are normally distributed

RECOMMENDATION:
  Model is ready for production deployment. Monitor performance metrics
  on new data and retrain if accuracy drops significantly.
